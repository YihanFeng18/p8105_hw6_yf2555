### Problem 1

The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You can read their accompanying article here.

Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.

For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age, sex and race as predictors. Save the output of glm as an R object; apply the broom::tidy to this object; and obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing non-white victims to white victims keeping all other variables fixed.

Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset, and extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing Black victims to white victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    city_state != "Tulsa, AL") %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```


Start with one city.

```{r}
baltimore_df =
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")
glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, 
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```


Try this across cities.

```{r}
models_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = 
      map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI")) 
```

```{r}
models_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```



## Problem 2

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these
Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect your model to be “optimal”.


#### Import and clean the dataset. Check for missing values. 

```{r message=F}
baby_df <-  
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  mutate(babysex = factor(case_when(babysex == 1 ~ "Male", 
                                    babysex == 2 ~ "Female"), 
                          levels = c("Male", "Female")),
         dad_race = factor(case_when(frace == 1 ~ "White", 
                                     frace == 2 ~ "Black",
                                     frace == 3 ~ "Asian",
                                     frace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
                                     frace == 8 ~ "Other",
                                     frace == 9 ~ "Unknwon"
                                     )),
         mom_race = factor(case_when(mrace == 1 ~ "White", 
                                     mrace == 2 ~ "Black",
                                     mrace == 3 ~ "Asian",
                                     mrace == 4 ~ "Puerto Rican",
                                     mrace == 8 ~ "Other"
                                     )),
         malformation = factor(case_when(malform == 1 ~ "Present", 
                                         malform == 0 ~ "Absent"),
                               levels = c("Present", "Absent"))) %>%
  select(-frace, -mrace, -malform)


# check for missing values
na <- baby_df %>%
  summarize_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

#### Fit a model between birthweight and number of cigerattes mom smoked per day during pregenancy

```{r}
gaweeks_model <- lm(bwt ~ gaweeks, data = baby_df)
```


```{r}
baby_df %>% 
  add_residuals(gaweeks_model) %>% 
  add_predictions(gaweeks_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = gaweeks, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. Predicted Values for Birthweight Model",
       x = "gestational age (week)",
       y = "Residuals")
```


#### Compare with other two models. 

1. Build the two models: 

* One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
* One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these


```{r}
lg_model <- lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = baby_df)
hls_model <- lm(bwt ~ bhead * blength * babysex, data = baby_df)
```


2. Cross Validation

```{r}
crossv_df <-
  crossv_mc(baby_df, 100) %>%
  mutate(
    train = map(train, as_tibble),
    test = map(test, as_tibble)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    gaweeks_model = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ gaweeks, data = .x)), 
    lg_model = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)),
    hls_model = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead + blength + babysex, data = .x))
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    gaweeks_model_rmse = map2_dbl(gaweeks_model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    lg_model_rmse = map2_dbl(lg_model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    hls_model_rmse = map2_dbl(hls_model, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y))
    )
```


3. Visualization 

```{r}
crossv_df %>%
  select(gaweeks_model_rmse, lg_model_rmse, hls_model_rmse) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(),
             names_to = "model", 
             values_to = "rmse") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(
    title = "Birthweight Model Comparison",
    x = "Models",
    y = "RMSE"
  )
```


## Problem 3

For this problem, we’ll use the 2017 Central Park weather data that we’ve seen elsewhere. The code chunk below (adapted from the course website) will download these data.

The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:

r^2
log(β^0∗β^1)
Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r^2 and log(β^0∗β^1). Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r^2 from a fitted regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should help in computing log(β^0∗β^1).

```{r}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
